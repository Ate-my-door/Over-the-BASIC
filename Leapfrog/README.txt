Leapfrog
--------

The game of leapfrog is a nice simple one: 

You start off with two opposing sets of frogs, 
and each frog can only move to an adjacent 
space or leap over one frog.

	X X X X - 0 0 0 0 
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

So, as a first move, for example the frog at 
position 4 can move to 5, or the frog 6 can 
move to 5, or the frog at 3 can leap over 
the frog at 4 to land at 5, or the frog at 7 
can leap over the frog at 6 to land at 5. 

The object of the game is to try to get all 
the frogs on the left to the right, and vice 
versa in the least number of moves. It's great 
fun! 

The program expects a 2-digit input to define 
the moves to and from. It will accept as a 
valid first move only the following inputs:

	35   45   65   75

Happy leapfrogging!
