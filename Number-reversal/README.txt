Number Reversal
---------------

This is a puzzle to test your powers of logic! 
You start with 9 numbers, from 1 to 9, in a 
random order. 

The aim is to get them into order in as few 
moves as possible. The only facility you have 
to change the order of the numbers is the 
ability to "reverse" the order of some of the 
elements. 

For example, if you had the first three numbers 
"3 2 1", then reversing the first three will 
give you "1 2 3". If you had reversed only the 
first two, you would have had "3 1 2".
